# Wine-Quality-Analysis-and-Classification
This project analyzes the chemical properties of wines and builds a machine learning model to classify wine quality. Using the Wine Quality Dataset, we explore how factors like acidity, alcohol content, sulphates, and chlorides contribute to wine ratings and how well a model can predict them.
