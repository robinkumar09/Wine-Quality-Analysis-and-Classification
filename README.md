# Wine-Quality-Analysis-and-Classification
This project explores how different chemical properties of wine relate to its final quality
rating, and how a machine learning model can learn these patterns to classify wine more accu
rately. Using the well-known Wine Quality dataset, we clean and preprocess the data, normalise
its features, and address the issue of class imbalance. We then build and tune a Random Forest
classifier to predict wine quality and identify the chemical factors that influence it the most.
Throughout the project, our aim has been to keep the analysis simple and clear, avoiding
unnecessary complexity. The goal is not only to build a working model but to understand what
makes a wine ”good” from a chemical point of view. Our results show that factors such as
alcohol content, acidity, sulphates, and chlorides play a strong role in determining wine quality.
The Random Forest classifier performs well on the dataset and also offers an interpretable way
to understand feature importance.
This study highlights how basic machine learning tools can help make sense of real-world
datasets and turn numbers into useful insights. It also shows how chemical measurements, often
seen only in laboratory settings, connect directly to the kind of quality assessment used in the
wine industry.
